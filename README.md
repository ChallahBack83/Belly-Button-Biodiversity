# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

The purpose of this project is to practice data visualization for web applications by using JavaScript, d3 and Bootstrap libraries, and CSS for styling an interactive page.  This week, the combination of these skills really pushed us to get acquainted with looking up documentation and debugging through the dev tools in our browser. 

The completed and deployed webpage can be found [HERE](https://challahback83.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/).

## Deliverables for this project included:

- A horizontal bar chart with the top 10 bacterias displayed in descending order.
- A bubble chart with size of bubble assigned to the count of each type of bacteria.
- A color coded gauge chart for the number of washing frequencies per week.
- All charts responsive and updating correctly through the drop down selection by Test Subject ID No.
- Personalization of our page with at least 3 changes.

For my personalization, I added the following:
- An image of bacteria to the jumbotron behind the header of the page.
- Title and subtitle font changes:
  - Bolded header in the html
  - Font family type switched to Times New Roman
  - Outline added to text to make stand out in front of image.
- Font for the titles and text of the graphs changed to Times New Roman for consistency.
- Graphs rearranged with the bubble chart on top
  - I think it fits the window better and it visually pops more than the other graphs.
- Graphs set to responsive to resize based on window size.
- Background color of page changed to a light grey.
  - This required a change in CSS to the <body> and the addition of page size.
  - To match, all the same color was added to the layouts of all the graphs using:
    - plot_bgcolor
    - paper_bgcolor
    
    
## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, this module really made me stretch my ability to research and find answers. The hardest part was figuring out the nuances of style changes such as the realization that to apply the background color in CSS, I need to assign height & width in order for it to work. Despite the frustration, I enjoyed the puzzle and learned how important it is to debug as you code. Finding errors step by step saved me even more time.  If I were able to continue editing this project I would:

- Change the font for the "Demographic Info" panel to match the rest of the page.
- Rethink the busy header photo for something that does not inhibit the text.
- Make the graphs more navigable, especially the bubble chart.
